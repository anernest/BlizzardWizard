ABSTRACT = {Regarding the purification of seawater, it is necessary to reduce both the total concentration of salt and also the concentration of boron to meet purity requirements for safe drinking water. For this purpose reverse osmosis membrane modules can be designed based on experimental data supported by computer models to determine energy efficient configurations and operating conditions. In previous studies numerical models have been suggested to predict the performance of the removal with respect to difference pressures, pH values, and temperatures. Here, an analytical model is suggested which allows for both the simplified fitting of the parameters required for predicting boron transport coefficients and also the simple equations that can be used for the design of combined seawater and boron removal systems. This modelling methodology is demonstrated through two case studies including FilmTec and Saehan membrane modules. For both cases the model is shown to be able to predict the performance with similar accuracy compared with existing finite-difference type numerical models from the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study is to provide preliminary exploration of how corporate social responsibility issues are currently reported and communicated by US major casino companies. Empirical evidence is drawn from standalone CSR reports and websites of the 30 largest casino companies in the US, which is explored through content analysis methodology. This paper finds that there are substantial variations in the reporting and communication of CSR issues by casino companies. While casino companies mainly rely on websites to communicate CSR issues, 23% of the sample companies use standalone CSR reports. Whereas websites tend to provide relatively limited information about CSR activities, standalone CSR reports have a tendency to cover comprehensive CSR themes in a detailed manner. In addition, the content analysis based on website reveals that while most casino companies tend to be passive about responsible gaming, some are trying to behave more actively and responsibly about this issue.},
